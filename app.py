Here, we first accept the filename 
from the user using the read command. 
Then, we check if the file exists using 
the -e option of the test command. If the file exists, 
we sort the file using the sort command and 
redirect the output to a new file with _sorted suffix. 
Finally, we display a message indicating that 
the file was sorted successfully and the 
name of the sorted file. If the file does not exist, 
we display a user-friendly error message 
asking the user to check the filename and try again.

Tags similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are immutable.
➢ It means, tag is a branch, which nobody intends to modify. Once a tag is created for a particular
commit, even if you create a new commit, it will not be updated.
➢ Usually, developers create tags for product release
