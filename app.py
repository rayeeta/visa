Here, we first accept the filename from the user using the read command. Then, we check if the file exists using the -e option of the test command. If the file exists, we sort the file using the sort command and redirect the output to a new file with _sorted suffix. Finally, we display a message indicating that the file was sorted successfully and the name of the sorted file. If the file does not exist, we display a user-friendly error message asking the user to check the filename and try again.
