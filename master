Here, we first accept the filename
from the user using the read command.
Then, we check if the file exists using
the -e option of the test command. If the file exists,
we sort the file using the sort command and
redirect the output to a new file with _sorted suffix.
Finally, we display a message indicating that
the file was sorted successfully and the
name of the sorted file. If the file does not exist,
we display a user-friendly error message
asking the user to check the filename and try again.
